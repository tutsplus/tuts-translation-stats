### Global Distribution of Translated Posts
#### Ian Yates and Michael James Williams

Hundreds of articles and tutorials have been translated into one or more languages as part of the [Tuts+ Translation Project](https://tutsplus.com/translate-for-us). Click on each language to see its relative traffic distribution across the globe. Pale green across the board shows fairly equal traffic from all the countries where pageviews were recorded. Countries with a darker green account for a greater share of the traffic.
